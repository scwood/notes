## Imitation Maple Syrup

## Pot Roast

The piece of meat I usually choose for a pot roast dinner is a chuck roast. For eight people you probably need a 4 to 5 lb piece of meat. You will need a large pan or frying pan and a roaster with a lid. First, have the heat quite high and put a little shortening in the pan and brown on all sides. Stay right with it so it doesn't burn. When it is nice and brown all over add some water, don't need to cover it with water but put in quite a bit. Add seasonings (whatever you have, mainly salt and pepper) and several onions cut in two or three pieces. Put in the over at around 225 cook for 4 to 5 hours. Check once in a while to see that it does not get dry.
