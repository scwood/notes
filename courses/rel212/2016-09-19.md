Paul was not the first missionaries in Cyprus or Antioch but he was the first to preach to the Gentiles

# Paul

Paul persecuted the saints but he did not do anything illegal, he was probably bothered by the murder of Steven (Hopkin).

Paul: Jewish name, Saul: Roman name.

# Experts of regions

James brother of Jesus: head of church in Jerusalem.
Paul and Barnabas: understand gentiles.

# Decision about Law of Moses

- Gentiles do not need circumcision
- Gentile converts must abstain from eating certain things
- 10 commandment type of things

- Synergistic relation: we work in a covenant relationship with God
- Monergistic relation: God is the only one who has a hand in your salvation

Whenever Paul says law it means the Law of Moses, whenever he says faith, he means a full bodied response, not an emotional response. I.e. faithfulness.

Justification: being pronounced /treated innocent with respect to God's laws.

How do you know if you're saved? The earnest of the Spirit
