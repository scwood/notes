When stoning, you have stained the land with your sin

During prohibition word of wisdom was not really followed.

## Steven's death

Steven was murdered because they didn't follow any of their own rules for these kinds of trials

His defense:

1. idk
2. God is greater than any temple
3. They were breaking rules

Stephen's view of the Father AND the Son was the final straw

## The early persecution

- Persecution: Jews persecuting other Jews (who believed that Jesus was the Messiah)
- Roman persecution of Christians happens much later

## Ethiopian Eunuch

- Why is his identity important? He could not have been circumcised so he could not have worshiped in the Temple. This shows that Christianity provides a place for all

## Correct Authority

- Acts 8 14-17, you must have the correct priesthood authority in order to lay on of hands
- There is a separation of the levels of the priesthood

## Cornelius

- First gentile to convert to Christianity
- Centurion: military leader
- Some gentiles wanted to convert but could not or would not for whatever reason
