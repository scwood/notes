# Romans

Jews are kicked out of Rome over disturbances over "Chrestus", gone from Rome for 5 years.

Paul sends Phebe (female representative) to Corinth to deliver his letter. This is problematic because Paul previously told saints not to listen to women.

1. We are saved by grace
2. It is grace that calls us to God (to repent) it is grace that enables us to come unto Christ. And it is grace that saves us in the end
3. Because God has given us agency, he does not force us to respond to His grace, we much choose to respond to his grace by faith
4. Faith is not just an emotional response to God's love. Faith is giving our all, through imperfect, in response to God's as God asks. We often call this faith response obedience or faithfulness
5. Just as a baby chooses to accept a parent's love by cuddling in or to reject it by staying rigid so we choose to response to and accept God's love by clinging to him with all of our heart, might, mind and strength.
