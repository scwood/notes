Review audience and unique situations/reasons/tone for each epistle (first few slides of each power point). Review main topics discussed with each epistle. Use the information below to lead you to the correct information in the power point.

## Romans

> The foundation of Romans is an attempt to answer the question of who needs salvation and why they need it

How do the Gentiles live the law of God?

> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves;  Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness

Abraham’s justification? 

> “Righteousness” = justification, God did NOT justify Abraham because he got circumcised. Circumcision was a sign of the justification God already gave Abraham because of faith.

What does Paul say about the advantage of being of the House of Israel?

> chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles (i.e. words of God through revelation, prophets, or scripture) of God. 

What does Paul say about human nature and why we sin?

> We are in a fallen nature. All are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made. Natural man is an enemy to God, and has been since Adam.

Sources of God’s foreknowledge.

> 1. God knows the future because of his omniscience. (This is a common Christian concept.) 
>
> 2. God knows us because we were with him in pre-mortality. (This is a unique, LDS concept.)

Romans 8:14-17.

> 14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
> 
> 15. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
> 
> 16. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
> 
> 17. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

## Acts 16-28

Know the following people, incidents, and concepts

- __Timothy__: Paul's mission companion whom Paul had circumcised
- __Eutychus__: boy who fell from a window while Paul was teaching; Paul embraced him and assured everyone that he wasn't dead
- __Lydia__: seller of purple, first European Christian convert
- __Felix__: Roman government official who hears the case against Paul, detains him for two years, tries to bribe Paul?
- __Festus__: Roman Governor of Judea, Paul had his final hearing before Festus 
- __Herod Agrippa II__: King who hears Paul's defence, "almost thou persuadest to be a Christian", Paul appeals to Ceaser
- __Paul’s beating at Philippi__: He was teaching them a lesson-he was a Roman citizen therefore it was illegal for them to beat him
- __Paul’s missionary pattern when going to a new city__: (1) visit local synagogues to meet Jews, (2) visit local markets to meet Gentiles
- __Jesus’s agrapha__: "sayings of Jesus not written in the Gospels", "It is better to give than to receive" (not found in Gospels but Paul stresses to remember)
- __Paul and the incident at the temple in Jerusalem__: Paul brings Greeks into the temple and therefore polluted the holy place, is arrested and imprisoned. Stands before the Sanhedrin
- __Paul on trial before Sanhedrin__: distracts the Sanhedrin by sparking an argument about the resurrection of the dead
- __Paul’s appeal to Caesar and journey to Rome__: shipwreck in Melita=Malta 
- __“we” passages__: Luke was actually present for these events OR Luke was using the travel diary of an eyewitness as a source for these events

- __Acts 26:28__: "Agrippa said to Paul, almost thou persuades me to be a christian"

## Philemon

Shortest letter, to slave owner, analogous to our relationship with Christ

- Slavery in ancient world:
  - legal under law of Moses for 7 years, could become voluntary after time expired, numerous legal rites
  - Roman slavery not based on race
  - Master owned the labor and the salve, no crime to abuse or kill, but did not happen very often 
- Epistle of Philemon as allegory of plan of salvation:
  - Paul doesn't want to abolish slavery for Christians, Paul wants Philemon to receive back his slave Onesimus as a brother in the Gospel plan 
  - Paul is like Christ, convinces the father to take us back, we are like Onesimus, Philemon represents God
- Redeemer: Go'el
- meaning of “Onesimus”: literally means "profitable or useful (in Latin)"

## Colossians

Christian congregation where Paul had not personal visited

- “unknown” epistle and other interesting “tidbits”:
  - Unknown epistle to the Ladocieans
  - Mentions Onesimus
  - Mentions [John] Mark the nephew of Barnabus
  - Mention of Luke, described as a physician
- Colossian Heresy: Jewish/Roman angels
  - Collosians demonstrates the danger of intellectual heresy-when the intellect trumps the spirit
  - Worship of angels (Jewish archangels or pagan heroes) is bad
- Col. 1:15-19: for in Christ all things were created... he is the head and body of the church... and it pleased the father

## Philippians

First church in Europe, established during the second missionary journey, Paul's happiest epistle

- Article of Faith 13: Philippians 4:8
- kenosis: "he emptied himself"
- ancient hymn & meaning: Philip 2: Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant
- Paul’s background: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee
- early Church organization & hierarchy: Bishops and Deacons 
- Philippians 3:8: Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,

## Ephesians

More of a stake or general letter.

- earnest of the spirit/holy spirit of promise: "earnest" money or "down-payment", God sends it to us, remind us that our contract is still valid concerning our future inheritance. God will eventually pay for us in full, but for now he sends the holy spirit as down payment. Ephesions 1
- emphasis upon unity: A & E were made from one flesh and commanded to cleave together
  - There is a difference in the way the priesthood works in the home as compared to the way it functions in the church, in the church there is clear line of authority, in the home it is a equal partnership with the husband equally yoked together.
- armor of God: Ephesians 6:13-17
- Ephesians 1:4-5: 4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. 5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

## 1-2 Timothy & Titus

The pastoral (keeping sheep) epistles. Personal letters to Timothy and Titus, not to entire concretion. Written from one Shepard (Paul) to another Shepard (Timothy/Titus) about pastoring/shepherding (Christian Leadership)

- Evidence that 2 Timothy is the last thing Paul writes
  - Paul is in prison in Rome, 2 Timothy is probably his last letter: "I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand"
  - My time is at hand, Paul gives departing testimony, Paul does not expect to be acquitted 
- Clear evidence of Apostasy-
- what Paul means when he battles “genealogy” and “science”
  - Don't speculate about the origin of the gods, Paul warns against the Gnostics who taught that they had correct knowledge about the origin of the gods
- 1 Tim. 2: teachings on women
- hesuchia: "silence, stillness, resistance from bustle or language"
- aidos: "modesty, awe"
- teachings regarding women: saved in childbearing, man created first, than the woman, maybe women at that time were overzealous?
- Guidelines for Bishops in 1 Tim 3
  - Should not seek for office, if someone wants to serve it is a good thing
  - Bishop: overseer
  - "A bishop must be blameless as the steward of God" Titus
  - "One wife" not referring to polygamy, but to divorce. Bishops should not unnecessarily divorce and remarried
  - "No novice" New members should not be given leadership positions unless it's necessary.
  - "Those without": Bishops should not pick fights with local religions, must get along well with all types of people and religions in the area
- Meaning of “Latter Days”
  - Paul spoke using a different definition for latter times, his focus was on the last days of the Christianity of his era, the 'latter-times' of the early church
  - "Last days" often refer to the current time period or the immediate future, rather than only 2000 years later
  - Paul used the term 'latter times' to denote the period in which the developments that he foretold would take place
  - Paul and others felt they were in the last days
