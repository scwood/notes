Review audience and unique situations/reasons/tone for each epistle (first few slides of each power point). Review main topics discussed with each epistle. Use the information below to lead you to the correct information in the power point.

## Romans

> The foundation of Romans is an attempt to answer the question of who needs salvation and why they need it

How do the Gentiles live the law of God?

> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves;  Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness

Abraham’s justification? 

> “Righteousness” = justification, God did NOT justify Abraham because he got circumcised. Circumcision was a sign of the justification God already gave Abraham because of faith.

What does Paul say about the advantage of being of the House of Israel?

> chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles (i.e. words of God through revelation, prophets, or scripture) of God. 

What does Paul say about human nature and why we sin?

> We are in a fallen nature. All are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made. Natural man is an enemy to God, and has been since Adam.

Sources of God’s foreknowledge.

> 1. God knows the future because of his omniscience. (This is a common Christian concept.) 
>
> 2. God knows us because we were with him in pre-mortality. (This is a unique, LDS concept.)

Romans 8:14-17.

> 14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
> 
> 15. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
> 
> 16. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
> 
> 17. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
