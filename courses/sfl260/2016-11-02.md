# P.I.T.I

# Eight things to do before buying a home

1. Know your budget and how much you can afford
2. Know your credit score
7. Have copies of taxes for two years
8. Get pre-approved

# How much house can I afford?

- Quick and dirty (Dr. Hill), take gross monthly income and divide by 5 (takes into account having more children and paying tithing).
- Front-end ration, Principal + interest + property taxes + insurance / monthly gross income is less than 28%.
- Back-end ration, PITI + any other long term debt / monthly gross income is less than 36%.

# Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)

If interest rates are high, pick ARM (not right now).

# Loan points

When interest rates are high, these are used to buy-down the interest rate. Right now, no points needed. 1 point = 1%.

# Costs

Down payment: 3%-20%. Closing costs: 2%-5% of the cost of the home. Total needed: 5%-25% of the cost.
