# Higher order and first class functions

First class means it can be passed around like any other datastructure.

Lambda is the function making operator.

```racket
(lambda (x) (+ x 1))
(define inc (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))

(define (inc-by x)
  (lambda (y)
    (+ x y)))

(define (compose f g)
  (lambda (x)
    (f (g x))))

(define (inc x) (+ 1 x))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define my-func (compose inc square))

(my-func 5)
```

Higher-order functions: functions that operate on other functions.

```racket
(define a (list 1 2 3 4))
(define (inc x) (+ x 1))
(map inc a)
```

Fold(r): basically reduce.

```racket
(define a (list 1 2 3 4))
(foldr + 0 a)
```
